boatd lite - the lightweight robotic sailing boat daemon 
=======================================

Based upon Boatd by Louis Taylor

This attempts to reduce the complexity of boatd by:

1. Running all code inside a single process, with multiple threads
2. Removing the web interface
3. Making it possible to run the entire control system from a single Python package
